The album title reflects B.o.B's idea of turning a negative situation into a positive one. In an interview with Genius.com, he explained: "To me 'Underground Luxury' is taking that which can be deemed as a miserable situation or that which somebody wouldn't want, and make it something luxurious." The album showcases B.o.B's versatility as an artist, blending different genres such as hip hop, pop, rock and R&B. The album also explores themes such as fame, money, love and spirituality.
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised B.o.B's charisma and production skills, but criticized his lack of originality and lyrical depth. The album debuted at number 22 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 35,000 copies in its first week. It also reached number 12 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 9 on the US Rap Albums chart. The album spawned four singles: "Headband", "Ready", "John Doe" and "We Still In This Bitch". The first three singles reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.
 
Underground Luxury is available for download and streaming on various platforms such as Qobuz[^1^], Genius[^2^] and SoundCloud[^3^].

The album's reception was not very positive among critics, who praised B.o.B's charisma and production skills, but criticized his lack of originality and lyrical depth. Rolling Stone gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying that "tracks with Future and 2 Chainz highlight his limitations on the mic, and without the Dr. Luke-assisted buoyancy of 2012's Strange Clouds, the album falls flat" [^1^]. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, calculated an average score of 51 based on 6 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews" [^2^]. AllMusic also gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that "the puzzling Underground Luxury mixes mack daddy music with mall rat tracks, even if B.o.B's conviction throughout suggests he sees them as equals" [^3^].
 
The album's singles also did not perform well on the charts. The lead single, "Headband", featuring 2 Chainz, peaked at number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The second single, "Ready", featuring Future, peaked at number 75 on the Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA. The third single, "John Doe", featuring Priscilla Renea, peaked at number 69 on the Hot 100 and was also certified gold by the RIAA. The fourth and final single, "We Still In This Bitch", featuring Juicy J and T.I., peaked at number 65 on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.
 
Despite the negative reviews and low sales, B.o.B expressed his satisfaction with the album in an interview with Billboard. He said: "I'm really proud of this project. I think it's one of my best works to date. I think it's going to be a classic album." He also said that he wanted to show his fans his growth as an artist and a person. He said: "I wanted to show people where I came from and where I'm at now. I wanted to show people that I'm not just a rapper or a singer or a musician. I'm an artist." He also hinted at his future plans, saying that he wanted to explore different genres and collaborate with more artists .
